EasyUO Reforged is a working, actively tested port, **not a finished release**. It is based on the last
public EasyUO source, which its author described as deprecated, so some features may be missing.

## What is verified

The interpreter core, the client data tables and the other logic that does not need a game client are
covered by automated tests. Anything that needs a running client is verified by hand, and only as far as
testing has reached. Confirmed against a live client so far:

- Detecting and attaching to a running client.
- Script execution: the interpreter, variables, flow control.
- [`FindItem`](/commands/finditem/) and the related item commands.
- The variable inspector and VarDump.
- [`menu`](/commands/menu/) windows: text, buttons, checkboxes, edit fields and images.
- The editor.

**Treat anything not listed as unverified**, and keep the original EasyUO next to it if you rely on
EasyUO for anything important, until you have checked that the scripts and features you need work.

## Known gaps

- **Client versions.** Only a few client builds are supported so far (including 7.0.117.0, 7.0.108.0 and
  7.0.99.1). Newer ones need their memory offsets derived first; see
  [Add a new client](/developers/adding-a-client/).
- **Symbol fonts in menus.** A [`menu`](/commands/menu/) text, button or checkbox using a symbol font such
  as Wingdings only shows the intended glyphs if that exact font is installed. Otherwise Windows substitutes
  another font, as the original did.
- **[`menu Image File`](/commands/menu/image/file/)** reliably loads BMP, PNG, JPEG and GIF. Older formats
  the original accepted (WMF, EMF, ICO) may not work.
- **64-bit Windows only.** EasyUO Reforged itself is 64-bit; it still drives the usual 32-bit UO client.
- **`uo.dll`**, the API for external programs, is built but has not been tested by a real external program
  yet.
- **EUOUpdater**, the tool for new client versions, has had only light testing.

Expect bugs in less common commands and menu features, and please
